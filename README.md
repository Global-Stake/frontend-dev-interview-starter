# Mini Transfers Challenge (Solana + SUI)

Welcome üëã  
This is a take-home coding challenge where you‚Äôll build a simple frontend to transfer tokens on **Solana Devnet** and **SUI Testnet**, integrating with wallet providers.

---

## üéØ Goal

Create a minimal web app where a user can:

- Connect a **Solana** wallet (via Reown AppKit)  
- Connect a **SUI** wallet (via Suiet Wallet Kit)  
- Input recipient + amount and send a transfer on each chain  
- View recent transactions in a table  

You‚Äôll be working inside a Next.js + TypeScript repo with starter code for both chains.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Test Networks

- **Solana:** Devnet  
  - Faucet: [https://solfaucet.com/](https://solfaucet.com/) or [https://faucet.solana.com/](https://faucet.solana.com/)  
  - RPC (used by default): `https://api.devnet.solana.com`

- **SUI:** Testnet  
  - Faucet: [https://faucet.sui.io/](https://faucet.sui.io/)  
  - RPC (used by default): `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io`

## ‚úÖ Candidate Tasks

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Resolve any dependency issues and ensure the app runs with `pnpm run dev`.

2. **Solana Integration**
   - Wire up Reown AppKit to connect a Solana devnet wallet.
   - Use the provided `createSolanaTransfer` helper to send SOL on devnet.
   - Show the connected public key in the UI.

3. **SUI Integration**
   - Wire up Suiet Wallet Kit to connect a SUI testnet wallet.
   - Use the provided `createSuiTransfer` helper to send SUI on testnet.
   - Show the connected address in the UI.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Fix the `TransferCard` component so it works on small screens (‚â§375px).
   - No horizontal scrolling, inputs should stack nicely.

5. **Transaction History**
   - Complete the provided hooks (`useSolanaTransactions`, `useSuiTransactions`) so the app can display transactions for the connected account.
   - Show them in the `TransactionTable` component.

6. **Bug Hunt**
   - One of the Solana/SUI transfer helpers has a subtle bug üêû. Identify and fix it.

7. **Documentation**
   - Add a short note in this README describing:
     - What changes you made
     - Any issues you ran into
     - How to run your solution

8. **Bonus Challenge**
   - Show off your design skills
     - Design a new homepage for the application
     - Make the transfer cards look nice
